/**Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.

Each teams competes 3 times, and the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per teams).

A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins.

1.) Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to claculate the
  averrage of 3 scores
  
2.) Use the function to calculate the average for both teams

3.) Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters (avgDoplhins and avgKoalas), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rules above.
EXAMPLE: 'Koalas win (30 vs. 13)'

4.) Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both DATA1 and DATA2

TEST DATA 1: Dolphins score 44, 23, 71, Koalas score 65,54, 49

TEST DATA 2: Dolphins score 85, 54, 41, Koalas score 23, 34, 27

HINT:
To check if number A is at least double number B, check A >= 2 * B, apply this to the team's average score */

//1
const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => (a + b + c) / 3;

//2
const scoreDoplhins = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
const scoreKoalas = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);
console.log(scoreDoplhins, scoreKoalas);

//3
const checkWinner = function (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {
  if (avgDolphins > 2 * avgKoalas) {
    console.log(`Dolphins are the winners ${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas}`);
  } else if (avgKoalas > 2 * avgDolphins) {
    console.log(`Koalas are the winners ${avgKoalas} vs. ${avgDolphins}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`There is no winner`);
  }
