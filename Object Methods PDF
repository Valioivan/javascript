/*** ///Object Methods PDF ************************************************************************
 *1. Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method
will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous
assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword.
2. Call the 'describe' method
3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if
there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property. **/
